**Introduction to Bioconductor Annotation Resources**

We are excited to invite you to the 2nd workshop of our R4Bioinfo series : Introduction to Bioconductor Annotation Resources.
During this workshop you'll learn about the different annotation packages provided by the Bioconductor project that can be used to incorporate additional information to results from high-throughput experiments.

Prerequisites :

Basic knowledge of R and [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/).

Invited speaker :

▶️ Dr. Martin Morgan: Director, Roswell Park R / Bioconductor Project.

About [Dr. Martin Morgan](https://github.com/mtmorgan) :

Dr. Morgan earned his undergraduate and Master's degrees in Botany at the University of Toronto. Dr. Morgan's PhD studies at the University of Chicago involved the evolutionary consequences of frequency-dependent selection, and of multilocus deleterious mutation.
Dr. Morgan spent 10 years as an Assistant and then Associate Professor at Washington State University, before joining the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 2005. At the Hutch, Dr. Morgan worked on the Bioconductor project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data; he has led Bioconductor since 2008. Dr. Morgan moved to Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, NY in 2015, where the Bioconductor project is now based.
